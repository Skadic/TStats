# TStats

A web-app that allows looking at the results of tournament stages including player rankings, frequency of picks etc.
There is barely much of anything implemented yet so this is nowhere near ready.


This project uses Astro, Svelte and Tailwind CSS in the frontend, and Rust, Rocket, sqlx and SQLite in the backend so far. 
This might be overkill but it is mostly for me to learn how to do webdev stuff.
